HOW TO LOAD THIS EXTENSION IN CHROME
====================================

1. Open Chrome and in the address bar type: chrome://extensions/

2. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner).

3. Click the button "Load unpacked".

4. In the file picker:
   - Go to: Documents → Chrome_Extension
   - Select the FOLDER named "Chrome_Extension" (click it once, then click "Open" or "Select")
   - Do NOT select "Documents" — you must select the Chrome_Extension folder itself.

5. If Chrome says it cannot access the folder:
   - Copy the whole "Chrome_Extension" folder to your Desktop (e.g. Desktop/Chrome_Extension).
   - In "Load unpacked", choose Desktop → Chrome_Extension.
   - Or: create a new folder on Desktop, unzip "SyllabusToExcel.zip" into it, then load that folder.

6. The extension should appear in your extensions list. Pin it to the toolbar if you like (click the puzzle icon, then pin "Syllabus to Excel").

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- "Invalid manifest": Make sure you selected the folder that contains manifest.json (Chrome_Extension), not a parent folder.
- "Could not load": Try moving Chrome_Extension to Desktop and load from there.
- On Mac, if a permission dialog appears for Chrome to access Documents or Desktop, click "OK" or "Allow".
