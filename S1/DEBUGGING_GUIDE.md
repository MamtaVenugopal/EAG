# Gmail Attachment Manager - Deletion Debugging Guide

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Gmail Attachment Manager"
3. Click the reload button

### Step 2: Test Delete Button Detection
1. Open Gmail with any email
2. Click extension icon
3. Click **"Test Delete Button Detection"** (red button)
4. Check debug output - does it find any delete buttons?

### Step 3: Test Deletion Only (NEW!)
1. Open Gmail with any email
2. Click extension icon  
3. Enable "Ask for confirmation before deleting email"
4. Click **"Test Deletion Only"** (red button)
5. This bypasses attachment download and tests deletion directly

### Step 4: Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages with emojis: 🔍 ✅ ❌ 🗑️ 📧 🧪

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### In Debug Output:
- "Found X elements with selector: ..." 
- "Suitable button found: ..."
- "Total buttons on page: X"

### In Console Logs:
- `🔍 Raw deletion settings from storage:`
- `✅ Deletion settings check result: true/false`
- `🗑️ User settings allow deletion, proceeding to delete email`
- `❌ Delete button not found with any method`

## 📋 REPORT BACK WITH:

1. **Delete Button Test Results:**
   - How many delete buttons were found?
   - Which selectors worked?
   - Any suitable buttons found?

2. **Console Log Messages:**
   - What deletion settings were loaded?
   - Did it reach the delete button clicking stage?
   - Any error messages?

3. **Test Deletion Results:**
   - Did the "Test Deletion Only" button work?
   - What was the final message?

## 🎯 LIKELY ISSUES:

1. **No delete buttons found** → Gmail interface changed
2. **Settings show deletion disabled** → Settings not saving properly  
3. **Delete button found but click fails** → Need different click method
4. **Everything looks good but email not deleted** → Gmail behavior issue
